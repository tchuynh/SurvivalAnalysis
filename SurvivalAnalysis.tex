	\subsection{Introduction}
	Survival Analysis is a collection of statistical procedures for data analysis for which the outcome variable of interest is time until an event occurs.
	More than one event may be considered in the same analysis, when more than one event is considered, the statistical problem can be characterized as either a recurrent event or a competing risk problems.  
	\subsubsection{Examples}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Leukemia patients and how long they stay in remission
			\item Disease free cohort measuring time until heart disease
			\item Elderly population to see how long subjects remain alive.
			\item Parolees to see whether they get rearrested.
			\item Heart transplant patients and how long they survive after transplant
		\end{itemize}
		
	
	\paragraph{$\epsilon$- neighborhood}
	Given a $\in \R$ and \eps $ >$ 0
	\begin{align*}
	V_{\epsilon}(a) = {x \in \R: |x-a| < \epsilon}
	\end{align*}
	In other words, $V_{\epsilon}$ is the open interval (a - $\epsilon$, a+ $\epsilon$), centered at a with radius $\epsilon$.
	\paragraph{Open}
	A set O \subsetR  $ $ is open if for all points a $\in$ O there exists an \eps-neighborhood $V_{\epsilon}$(a) $\subseteq$ O.
	\paragraph{Theorem 3.2.3}
	The union of an arbitrary collection of opens sets is open.\\
	The intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open.
	
	\subsection{Closed Sets}
	
	\paragraph{Limit Point:}
	A point x is a limit point of a set A if every $\epsilon$-neighborhood $V_{\epsilon}(x)$ of x 	intersects the set A at some point other than x.
